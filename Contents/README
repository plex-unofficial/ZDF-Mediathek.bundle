You can adjust __init__.py to add shortcuts to your favorit shows.
Just add them to the SHOWS array. Examples are included.

You can adjust how many videos per show should be displayed using the 
variable MAX_ENRIES.
ZDF displays 26 videos per show by default and links to more videos. In
this plugin, you can specify how many videos should be displayed per show.
The default is 50. Increasing this number might cause a significant delay
to display the video list as more data has to be fetched from the server.

You can also decide whether you want the plugin to display trailers. By
default, trailers are not displayed.

Also, "Interaktive Inhalte" and "Bilderserien" are not displayed.
"Bilderserien" might be supported in a future version of the plugin.
